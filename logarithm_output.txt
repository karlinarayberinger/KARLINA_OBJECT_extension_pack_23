This C++ program computes the (approximate) logarithm of x in some given logarithmic base.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, x, to take the logarithm of and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for x is 16.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, logarithmic_base, which is a positive real number other than one and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 2.

--------------------------------

result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(16, 2) = 3.998114109039306640625.

x = logarithmic_base ^ result --> 16 = 2 ^ 3.998114109039306640625.

x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(2, 3.998114109039306640625) = 16.00697779719589419755720882676541805267333984375.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, x, to take the logarithm of and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for x is -4.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, logarithmic_base, which is a positive real number other than one and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 2.

--------------------------------

Due to fact that x was determined to be either less than or equal to zero or else greater than 10000, x was set to the default value 1.

result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(1, 2) = 0.0006286196294240653514862060546875.

x = logarithmic_base ^ result --> 1 = 2 ^ 0.0006286196294240653514862060546875.

x = power(logarithmic_base, result) = power(2, 0.0006286196294240653514862060546875) = 1.000436095069968445159247494302690029144287109375.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, logarithmic_base, which is a positive real number other than one and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 1.

--------------------------------

Due to fact that logarithmic_base was determined to be either less than or equal to zero or else equal to one or else greater than 10000, logarithmic_base was set to the default value 2.

result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(3, 2) = 1.5845711231231689453125.

x = logarithmic_base ^ result --> 3 = 2 ^ 1.5845711231231689453125.

The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 9999.

--------------------------------

result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(10000, 9999) = 1.000010967254638671875.

x = logarithmic_base ^ result --> 10000 = 9999 ^ 1.000010967254638671875.
